My Learnings from the Specialization

This specialization from coursera consists of four courses. Below are my learnings from individual courses.

Course1: Custom Models, Layers, and Loss Functions with TensorFlow

Build models that produce multiple outputs (including a Siamese network) using the Functional API
Build custom loss functions (including the contrastive loss function used in a Siamese network)
Build custom layers using existing standard layers, customized network layer with a lambda layer and explored activation functions for custom layers
Build custom classes instead of using the Functional or Sequential APIs
Build models that can be inherited from the TensorFlow Model class, and build a residual network (ResNet) through defining a custom model class
Course2: Custom and Distributed Training with TensorFlow

Learned about the difference between the eager and graph modes in TensorFlow
Build custom training loops using GradientTape and TensorFlow Datasets to gain more flexibility and visibility with the model training
Got an overview of various distributed training strategies, and practice working with a strategy that trains on multiple GPU cores, and another that trains on multiple TPU cores
Course3: Advanced Computer Vision with TensorFlow

Build image classification, image segmentation, object localization, and object detection models
Used object detection models such as R-CNN, customized existing models, and build own models to detect, localize, and label rubber duck images
Implemented image segmentation using variations of the fully convolutional network (FCN) including U-Net and Mask-RCNN to identify and detect numbers, pets, zombies
Identified which parts of an image are being used by the model to make its predictions using class activation maps and saliency maps
Course4: Generative Deep Learning with TensorFlow

Generated artwork using neural style transfer: extract the content of an image (eg. swan), and the style of a painting (eg. cubist or impressionist), and combine the content and style into a new image
Build simple AutoEncoders on the familiar MNIST dataset, and more complex deep and convolutional architectures on the Fashion MNIST dataset
Identified ways to de-noise noisy images, and build a CNN AutoEncoder using TensorFlow to output a clean image from a noisy one
Build Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) to generate entirely new data, and generated anime faces to compare them against reference images
Learned about GANs, the concept of 2 training phases, the role of introduced noise and build GANs to generate faces
